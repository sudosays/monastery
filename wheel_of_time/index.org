* Working Theories
** The Female Half of the One Power is Tainted
    _Supporting evidence:_
    1. In /The Eye of the World/ Nynaeve notes that she can feel a sickly oily energy flowing around them.
        If the male half of the One Power is inaccessible to her, then she must be feeling the female half of the power, which feels tainted.
    2. Use of the One Power by women has a negative effect on them. Touching the One Power without guidance or training is considered dangerous.
