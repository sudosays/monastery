#+title: Holywar

These are my thoughts on the vi (vim, neovim etc) vs emacs debate.

* Church of Emacs

Currently using: DOOM Emacs

Previously tried: Spacemacs

** Likes
+ Org-mode
+ Customisability with elisp

** Dislikes
+ Terminal emulation is iffy at best

* Cult of vi

Previously tried:
+ Vanilla vim + custom vimconf (changed leader keys etc)
  - plugins managed with pathogen
+ Neovim (needs experimentation w/ plugins)

** Likes
+ Fast, snappy load times
+ terminal native.

** Dislikes
+ Lacks image support (cause term)
+ vimconf can break/be finicky
+ Plugin updating is an annoyance
