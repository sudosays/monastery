* Rsync

Rsync is a useful utility for synchronising files and dir contents (remotely or locally)

The basic format of the command is ~rsync source destination~ where it will try to ensure that the ~destination~ looks like the ~source~.

For remote/ssh rsync the above format still applies but the remote location is specified as ~user@server:destination~

Examples:

1) Make remote look like local:

   #begin_example
   rsync -r ~/local/ alice@example.com:~/local/
   #end_example

   The ~-r~ flag is for recursing into directories. /Note that the trailing slash on the directories is important to ensure that rsync understands that the directory is being compared to a directory./

* SSH & SFTP

Connect to SFTP via jump host

Use the ~-J~ flag to specify jump hosts a la:
#+begin_src bash
sftp -J user@jumpserver user@destination
#+end_src
