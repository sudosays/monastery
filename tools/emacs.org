** Toggle all timestamp headings in a logbook to inactive

Evaluate the following in the buffer:
#+begin_src elisp
(org-map-entries '(lambda () (right-word 1)(org-toggle-timestamp-type)) "LEVEL=2")
#+end_src

** Taking meeting minutes with timestamps

Use ~C-c !~ to add an inactive timestamp. In the time prompt put +0h to add the current up to the minute time or +0s to add up to the second time.

Additionally, insert a heading first with ~C-M-RET~ (typically ~M~ is alt) then
insert the inactive timestamp. Reconsider if using headings for action points with TODOs.
