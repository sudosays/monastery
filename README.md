# Welcome to the Monastery #

This is a repository where I keep all my notes on various dev and non-dev related topics.

The current list of topics found in here is:
- [ ] Android
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Rust programming language
- [ ] Data Structures and Algorithms

## Using these notes

Currently I am in the process of transitioning from using LaTeX to a more
web-friendly/interactive format using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

For LaTeX notes:
```
make
```

For mdBook notes:
```
mdbook build && mdbook serve
```
