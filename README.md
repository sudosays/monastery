# Welcome to the Monastery #

This is a repository where I keep all my notes on various dev and non-dev related topics.

The current list of topics found in here is:
- Android [In progress]
- Reinforcement Learning [In progress]
- Rust programming language

## Using these notes

Currently I am in the process of transitioning from using LaTeX to a more
web-friendly/interactive format using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

For LaTeX notes:
```
make
```

For mdBook notes:
```
mdbook build && mdbook serve
```

## Contributing

If you would like to add your own notes, please fork this repository and remember to append yourself as an author on all docs.
