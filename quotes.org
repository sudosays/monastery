Considering how  many  fools  can  calculate,  it  is  surprising  that  it
should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to
learn how to master the same tricks. Some calculus-tricks are quite easy.  Some
are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced
mathematics --- and they are mostly clever fools --- seldom take the trouble to
show you how easy the  easy  calculations  are.

On  the  contrary,  they  seem to  desire  to impress you with their tremendous
cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way. Being  myself  a
remarkably  stupid  fellow,  I  have had  to  unteach myself the difficulties,
and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts  that  are  not  hard.
Master  these  thoroughly,  and  the rest  will follow.

What one fool can do, another can.

-- Slivanus P Thompson, from the preface of /Calculus Made Easy/.
