5 Step calculation method:

1. Find opponent's threats
   + Potential checks, undefended pieces.
   + Essentially performing calculation from opponent's POV
2. Identify tactical targets and motifs
   + Look for pins, skewers, discovered attacks etc
   + Tactical targets are ones who can be placed under threat or weakened.
3. Calculate all the checks
4. Calculate all the captures
5. Calculate all the tempo moves
   + Tempo moves make a serious threat against the opponent that they have to respond to and make them lose a tempo
