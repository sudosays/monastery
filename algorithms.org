** Graph algoritms
*** Djikstra's Algorithm

Finds the shortest distances from a source node in a graphs to all other
nodes in the graph. The algorithm may be stopped early when seeking the
shortest distance between two nodes only.

For the purpose of illustration we will be using the problem of
determining the most effective flights from my hometown airport in
George, South Africa (blue) and Vancouver, Canada (red).

The possible flights we can choose from are listed below as well as a
made up "ugh" score (a combination of the flight time and cost).

| From | To  | Ugh |
|------+-----+-----|
| GRJ  | CPT | 1   |
| GRJ  | JHB | 2   |
| CPT  | DXB | 9   |
| CPT  | JFK | 22  |
| JHB  | DXB | 10  |
| JHB  | LHR | 17  |
| DXB  | LHR | 8   |
| DXB  | JFK | 14  |
| LHR  | YVR | 9   |
| JFK  | YVR | 8   |

** Sorting algorithms
*** Heapsort

For the purposes of learning the heapsort we will use the scenario of
organising medical case file of a virus outbreak. Due to the immense
strain on resources, these case files have been randomly entered into
the system, but the medical staff now need all of the case files in
chronological order so that they can build an accurate timeline of the
virus spread.

Luckily, the case files are keyed with a 17-digit case reference number
that is constructed using the date, time, and a sequence number.

#+begin_example
  0000 00 00 00 00 00 000

  <year> <month> <day> <hour> <minute> <second> <sequence>
#+end_example

Since the resources available are relatively constrained and it is time
sensitive, we have chosen the heapsort because:
+ it has a running complexity of $O(n\log{}n)$
+ it sorts the records in place

Using a heapsort is interesting because it leverages a data structure
(the heap) as opposed to an efficient method. Essentially, heapsort
boils down to building the heap ($O(n)$), and $n-1$ heapify
operations ($O(\log{}n)$ each) to do the final sort.
